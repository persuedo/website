        <h2>Hey there! Welcome to my page</h2>
        <p> I’m Rayaan Yusuf, a freshman at UW Seattle with a passion for coding and creating. I’m always looking for new ways to bring my ideas to life and to use technology in ways that feel meaningful.
        This website is both a portfolio and a personal project. You’ll find a Reading Corner with book reviews and recommendations, a STEM 4 ALL page with resources for students interested in STEM, and a space to learn more about me. Eventually, I hope to grow this site into an app where young adults can share book recommendations, leave reviews, and connect with others.
        Outside of school and coding, I care a lot about community and making space for others. I also love small joys — a good playlist, a cozy bookstore, or finally getting something I’ve been working on to click. I’m excited to keep learning, keep building, and share that process here.</p>
